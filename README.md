## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Whisper model (for STT functionality) - Downloaded automatically on first use, or pre-download with `download_whisper_model.py`

## Setup & Configuration

### STT (Speech-to-Text) Setup

**Offline Whisper STT (Recommended - Works Offline):**

1. **Install Whisper**:
   ```bash
   pip install openai-whisper
   ```

2. **Pre-download Model (Optional, but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   # Download small model (default - optimized for accuracy and speed)
   python download_whisper_model.py --model small
   
   # Or download other models:
   # python download_whisper_model.py --model tiny   # Fastest, lower accuracy
   # python download_whisper_model.py --model base   # Fast, good accuracy
   # python download_whisper_model.py --model small  # Better accuracy (default)
   # python download_whisper_model.py --model medium # High accuracy, slower
   # python download_whisper_model.py --model large   # Highest accuracy, slowest
   ```

3. **Model Sizes**:
   - **tiny**: ~39MB, fastest, lower accuracy (good for testing)
   - **base**: ~74MB, fast, good accuracy
   - **small**: ~244MB, optimized speed/accuracy balance (**default, recommended**)
   - **medium**: ~769MB, high accuracy, slower
   - **large**: ~1550MB, highest accuracy, slowest
   
   **Note**: The default model is `small`, which is optimized with `beam_size=3`, `best_of=3`, and `fp16` acceleration (if available) for the best balance of speed and accuracy.

4. **STT Features**:
   - ✅ **Fully offline** - No internet connection required after model download
   - ✅ Automatically detects language (English, Chinese, Japanese)
   - ✅ Low-latency real-time transcription with interim results (optimized for speed)
   - ✅ Works with both microphone and system audio modes
   - ✅ Models are cached locally after first download
   - ✅ Optimized transcription parameters for speed (beam_size=3, best_of=3)
   - ✅ GPU/MPS acceleration support (fp16) for faster processing when available
   - ✅ Accurate confidence scoring (95-100% for final transcriptions)

**Note**: The model will be downloaded automatically on first use if not pre-downloaded, but this requires an internet connection. Pre-downloading ensures offline operation from the start.

### TTS (Text-to-Speech) Setup

TTS is optional. To enable TTS functionality:

**Install all TTS dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Pre-download models for offline use (requires internet once):**
```bash
# Download all models (English, Chinese, Japanese)
python download_tts_model.py --lang all

# Or download individually:
python download_tts_model.py --lang en  # English (MMS-TTS)
python download_tts_model.py --lang zh  # Chinese (PyKokoro - faster than Piper)
python download_tts_model.py --lang ja  # Japanese (PyKokoro)
```

**TTS Engines:**
- ✅ **English**: MMS-TTS (PyTorch-based, neural TTS) - Offline after download
- ✅ **Chinese**: PyKokoro (neural TTS, faster than Piper, no g2pw overhead) - Offline after download
- ✅ **Japanese**: PyKokoro (neural TTS, natural-sounding) - Offline after download

**Additional dependencies for Chinese/Japanese TTS (PyKokoro):**
```bash
# PyKokoro requires spaCy language models and Chinese-specific dependencies
pip install spacy cn2an jieba
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # Required for both Chinese and Japanese
python -m spacy download zh_core_web_sm   # Required for Chinese TTS
python -m spacy download ja_core_news_sm  # Recommended for better Japanese processing
```

**Note**: 
- `cn2an` is required for Chinese TTS to handle number conversion (Chinese numerals ↔ Arabic numerals)
- `jieba` is required for Chinese TTS to perform word segmentation (breaking Chinese text into words)

**Note**: Chinese TTS now uses PyKokoro instead of Piper TTS for better performance and lower latency. The old Piper TTS dependencies (g2pw, unicode-rbnf, sentence-stream) are no longer required.

**Offline Operation:**
- ✅ **All TTS engines**: Work completely offline after initial model download
- ✅ **Model caching**: Models are cached in memory for fast subsequent requests
- ✅ **No internet required**: After initial setup, all TTS works without internet

**Note**: TTS automatically detects language from input text - no manual language selection needed!

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Capture Issues
- **System audio not working**: Check system audio device setup (see System Audio Setup section)
- **VAD not working**: Ensure audio is playing and system audio device is configured correctly
- **Audio level not updating**: Verify audio is being captured and check browser console for errors

### STT Issues
- **No transcriptions appearing**: 
  - Check that Whisper is installed: `pip install openai-whisper`
  - Verify model is downloaded (check `~/.cache/whisper/` directory)
  - Model downloads automatically on first use (requires internet once)
  - Check server logs for model loading errors
  - Check browser console for errors
- **Transcriptions cut off**: 
  - Wait for speech to complete - final transcription appears after speech ends
  - Check that audio is being captured properly
  - Whisper processes audio in chunks, so there may be a slight delay
  - The system uses pre-buffering and extended stopping periods to capture complete speech
- **Wrong language detected**: 
  - Language is auto-detected from audio content
  - For mixed-language audio, the dominant language will be detected
- **Slow transcription**: 
  - The default `small` model is already optimized for speed (beam_size=3, best_of=3)
  - Use a smaller model (e.g., `tiny` or `base` instead of `small`) for even faster processing
  - Edit `backend/audio/pipeline.py` to change model size in `WhisperOfflineSTT` initialization
  - GPU/MPS acceleration (fp16) is automatically enabled if available for faster processing
- **Model download fails**: 
  - Check internet connection (required only for first download)
  - Manually download: `python download_whisper_model.py --model base`
  - Models are cached in `~/.cache/whisper/` after download

### TTS Issues
- **TTS not available error**: 
  - Install TTS dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - For Japanese: Install spaCy models: `pip install spacy && python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
  - Restart server after installing dependencies
- **No audio playback**: 
  - Check browser console for errors
  - Verify audio permissions in browser
  - Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- **Wrong language for TTS**: 
  - Language is automatically detected from text
  - English text uses MMS-TTS (offline)
  - Chinese text uses Piper TTS (offline)
  - Japanese text uses PyKokoro (offline)
- **Model download errors**:
  - Ensure internet connection for initial download
  - Run `python download_tts_model.py --lang <language>` to pre-download models
  - Models are cached locally after download for offline use
- **Japanese TTS not working**:
  - Ensure PyKokoro is installed: `pip install pykokoro`
  - Install spaCy models: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
  - Check server logs for specific error messages
